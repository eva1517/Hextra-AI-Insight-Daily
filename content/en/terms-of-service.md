Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (hereinafter "the Site" or "We"). Before you jump into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're agreeing to and accepting these terms. Let's make sure we're all on the same page! 😊

## 1. Service Overview
**The Site** offers users paid subscription content and membership services, such as blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction. Some content is exclusively for subscribers. ✨

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   **Users** are required to provide a valid email address and set a password for account registration.
*   **Users** are responsible for their account's security and all activities; transferring or sharing accounts is strictly **forbidden**! 🙅‍♀️
*   **The Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account in the event of a violation of these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with fees clearly displayed on the checkout page. No hidden surprises! 💰
*   **All payments** are processed via third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal); the Site will never store your payment information. Your security is our priority. 🛡️
*   **Subscriptions** will **auto-renew** unless you cancel prior to the end of the current billing cycle. Don't forget to mark your calendar if you want to stop! 🗓️
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** allows first-time subscribers to request a full refund within 14 days from the purchase date if they are unsatisfied with the service. Just reach out to us via the email provided at the end of these terms and explain your reason for the refund. Each user is eligible for one refund only. For purchases made beyond 14 days or by non-first-time subscribers, **no refunds** will be issued after payment unless legally mandated. We want you to be happy with your choice! 👍

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**; unauthorized copying, reproduction, or commercial use is strictly prohibited. Let's respect intellectual property! 🚫

*   **Users** are **prohibited** from using technical means to bulk download, scrape, or crack member content. Play fair! 🚫
*   **The Site** reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. We're serious about maintaining a positive community. 🚨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Think of it as evolving! 🚀
*   **The Site** **bears no liability for compensation** if content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failure, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things are just out of our control! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **Information provided by the Site** is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (e.g., financial, legal, medical). Always consult a pro for that! 🧑‍💼
*   **The Site** **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users incur from using our content or services. Use your best judgment! 🤔

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Keeping things legally clear! ⚖️
*   **Any disputes** arising from or related to these terms shall first be resolved through friendly negotiation; if negotiation fails, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Let's try to talk it out first, okay? 🤝
