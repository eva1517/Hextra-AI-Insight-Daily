### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located.

But hey, keep in mind, we might need to hang onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is super important to us! However, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is ever 100% secure. While we totally strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. 😬

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we figure out that we've collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers. 🧒🚫

If we need to lean on consent as a legal basis for processing your information, and your country requires consent from a parent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that information.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that we don't operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get whisked away to that third-party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit! 🔗

We have zero control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
